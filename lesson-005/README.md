### Naming Variables

There are 3 common problems that programmers face every single day:

1. What to name things
2. Off by one errors

_(I know what I said, there are no typos here!)_

There is nothing stopping you from naming your variable `chickenNugget`, but you **_should_** name your variables in a
way where the name describes the purpose of the variable.

So for our bla bla create variables for a box: width, length, height, volume, etc.
