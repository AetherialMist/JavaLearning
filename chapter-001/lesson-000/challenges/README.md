# Challenges

Each challenge will have a _possible solution_ provided. I strongly encourage you to try completing the challenge
**before** looking as a possible solution. I use the phrase "possible solution" because, in programming, there are many
ways to accomplish the same goal. Your solution and my solution may look very different, but are both _correct_.

Create new projects for each of the following challenges:

1. Print three different messages.
    * _Hint: Add more print statements on new lines below the first._
    * [Possible Solution](completed/PrintThree/src/aetherial/PrintThree.java)
2. Print five different messages.
    * [Possible Solution](completed/PrintFive/src/aetherial/PrintFive.java)
3. Print a pattern:
   ```text
      J    A    V     V    A
      J   A A    V   V    A A
   J  J  AAAAA    V V    AAAAA
    JJ  A     A    V    A     A
   ```
