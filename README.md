# JavaLearning

_Teaching my friends how to code!_

The general goal of this project is to teach Java programming starting from the very beginning. The secondary goal 
specific to this guide, is that each lesson take 30 minutes or less to complete. People have busy lives, so being 
able to split lessons into bite-sized chunks allows them to start and stop as they have free time.

## Lessons

* [Lesson 0](lesson-000) - Getting ready to code!
* [Lesson 1](lesson-001) - Hello World! First Java program
* [Lesson 2](lesson-002) - Intro to Types
* [Lesson 3](lesson-003) - Intro to Types Part 2
